								<h2>About</h2>
							</header>

							<p>The AgentFree website is a tool for aspiring athletes to present themselves to Teams or Schools before securing an agent and/or without having to pay an Agent. In the style of familiar Social Media platforms, Athletes set up a Profile listing their statistics, accolades and edited sporting highlights. They can choose to make their Profile either Public, so scouts searching can find them, or Private, from where they can send a link to allow the recipient to view their profile.

								<h2>Aim</h2>
							</header>


							<p>The Aim of AgentFree is to cut out the middle man which, in this case, is the agent who traditionally you have to pay to get your portfolio in front of a potential client. AgentFree enables the athlete to do this themselves. Setting up a profile requires no technical knowledge because the template is set up for them to fill. AgentFree also has a messaging feature which also eliminates Emailing or Texting. </p>

							<p>AgentFree aims to help athletes who are at the beginning of their career; all they need is an internet connection and their profile is available to the world.</p>

								<h2>Visual Direction</h2>
							</header>

						

							<p>At the beginning of a career I want the users to feel proud and confident in joining up, and to portray that AgentFree will have a professional, no-nonsense sleek look. This is achieved by having a minimal and simple interface for the user. AgentFree will feel familiar to the Target Market; I have purposefully designed it to be similar to other social media websites so the user intuitively feels like they have used a website like this before; they are confident in building and managing a profile, uploading stats and editing a Showreel of Highlights. </p>


							<p>My minimal colour palette that will enhance this sense of familiarity. These colours are not garish or “in your face”, rather they give a sense of welcome. The design and uses of this cool palette does not distract and in fact highlights the colour Profile photos and the Moving images. </p>

							<p>The Logo uses two distinct fonts - I created the formal font for the letters AF to stand strong and solid - the A leans into the F as if being supported and sheltered. The words Agent Free are in the ‘SignatureVP’ font - In stark contrast to the AF letting it is free form handwriting reminding the viewer the power and commitment of an individual's signature on a contract.  </p>

								<h2>Target</h2>
							</header>

							<p>AgentFree is a hands-on tool aimed not only at Young male or female Athletes who are looking to make a career out of the sport but also Young Athletes who want to be recognised by better teams and coaches.  AgentFree will appeal to a teen looking for a scholarship to a school, or someone looking for a team overseas, or even in their own region or their own Club. No matter how old they are, how good of an athlete they are or what sport they play, AgentFree is inclusive to everyone. AgentFree has a secondary market among Agents and Managers who want to recruit new talent to their stable and also among Coaches and Managers looking for a new up and coming athlete.</p>

<a href="https://www.starnow.co.nz">Click here to view 'Star Now's Website</a>.</h2>

	<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2020-08-18 at 1.27.21 PM.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>My first inspiration for the Website was an awareness that some young sports people struggled to find the next move after leaving their College or Club Teams. Unless they had been in expensive Academies they had little chance of being “discovered” or offered scholarships overseas or even to be noticed by Clubs when they moved to new cities or wanted to move on up to one of the higher grades in a better Club. </p>

<p>The sort of promotion required is not dissimilar to promoting and marketing Talent to the Film and Television industry.  StarNow is a website where aspiring actors, independent of an agent, pay for a profile so that they can be found and they can also submit their profiles to Casting Directors who place job opportunities on the site.

							<p>My second Inspiration came from my love for Football and keeping up with professional players careers and stats. I use this site ‘WYSCOUT’ to view players stats and performances. I took inspiration from the look of the website and how they display the athletes profiles. </p>
